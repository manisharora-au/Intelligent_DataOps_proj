# Terraform Variables Example
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your values
# DO NOT commit terraform.tfvars to git - it may contain sensitive data

# GCP Project Configuration
project_id = "manish-sandpit"
region     = "us-central1"
zone       = "us-central1-a"

# Environment
environment = "dev"

# Service Account Credentials
# Path to the service account JSON key file
credentials_file = "~/.gcp/credentials/terraform-dataops-key.json"

# Alternative: Use environment variable instead of file path
# export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="~/.gcp/credentials/terraform-dataops-key.json"
# credentials_file = ""  # Leave empty to use environment variable
