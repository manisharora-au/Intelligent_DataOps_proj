1. IoT Fleet Telemetry Data
• Vehicle Telematics Datasets:
    o UCI Machine Learning Repository – Vehicle Sensor Data (Basic but a start)
    o Fleet Telemetry Dataset on Kaggle — US traffic & accident data with geo info
    o Open Vehicle Monitoring System (OVMS) — open-source telemetry data for electric vehicles
• IoT Sensor Data Repositories:
    o UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset (for sensor simulation)
    o Azure Open Datasets — IoT datasets (contains some sensor & device telemetry)
• Synthetic Data Generators:
    o Mockaroo — generate custom vehicle telemetry data for testing pipelines
    o Tonic.ai — synthetic realistic data generator
 
2. Supplier APIs
• Public APIs for Logistics / Supply Chain:
    o Open Logistics APIs — catalog of open logistics/supply chain APIs
    o EasyPost API — shipping & parcel tracking API (free tier)
    o Shippo API — multi-carrier shipping API with tracking info
    o UPS Developer APIs — package tracking, rates, and shipping
• E-Commerce / Supplier Data APIs:
    o Amazon Product Advertising API
    o AliExpress API
• Open Data APIs for Supply Chain:
    o U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics API
    o European Data Portal — Transport APIs
 
3. Historical Databases
• Open Datasets for Historical Logistics/Transport Data:
    o US DOT National Transportation Atlas Database
    o NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission Trip Record Data
    o US NOAA Weather & Climate Data (useful for weather impact analysis on logistics)
• General Open Data Platforms:
    o Google Cloud Public Datasets
    o AWS Open Data Registry
    o Kaggle Datasets
 
4. Tools for API Testing & Simulation
• Postman API Network — explore thousands of public APIs
• RapidAPI Marketplace — find APIs, including shipping/logistics
 
Tip:
If you want realistic real-time streams for testing ingestion, consider:
• Using IoT device simulators that push telemetry data to MQTT or HTTP endpoints (e.g., Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT broker)
• Writing scripts that replay historical datasets as streaming events
